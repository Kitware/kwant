# KWANT #
Kitware Analytics Toolkit
--------------------

KWANT is an open source C++ toolkit for computing scores and other
metrics for object tracking systems.

For more details, see
[this rudimentary documentation](scoring_framework/README.markdown).

Pending support for e.g. GeographicLib in kwiver, this release only
supports pixel-coordinate AOIs.
